This is a simple SQL project for my DataBase course. It uses sql script in order to manage the system of Restaurant.
Basically it has multiple table in I have stored data for Employees, Customer and the Menu Card. Also we can see that which dish was ordered by which customer and what was its quantity.
Its more of a real life project in a sense that, as in real life we can order the dish we want and it can be given to us through delivery, this project uses that sense and shows the data of the customers who wanted delivery of there specific dish. Also, there are two tables which deal with the reservation of the tables. Like when we visit a restaurant, we can see that which table is taken 
and whioch is available for us, just like that customer can see the data of reservation and can see that who reserve that table.
It uses multiple SQL procedures in order to give it a more professional touch. Multiple SQL queiries have been used in this project, for understanding the concepts of SQL and having a strong grip on it.
